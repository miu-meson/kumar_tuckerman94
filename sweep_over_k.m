% The Floquet multipliers are eigenvalues of a real mapping: this implies that
% they are either real or complex-conjugate pairs. In addition, α is ω-periodic.
% The two cases α = 0 and α = ω/2 are called harmonic and subharmonic,
% respectively, and correspond to positive or negative real Floquet multipliers,
% whereas intermediate values correspond to a complex Floquet multiplier.
%
% The procedure for the stability analysis is to fix the wavenumber 'k' and
% the exponents 'σ + iɑ', usually as σ=0 and at ɑ=0 or ɑ=1/2ω. We then solve 
% (3.15) for the eigenvalues 'a'. Only real and positive values of 'a' are 
% meaningful in this context.

%% Assemble the full hydrodynamic system matrix for the special case
% Taken from the appendix B of Kumar & Tuckerman (1994).
%
% In the Floquet expansions (3.1) and (3.2), the nth coefficient w_jn of the
% vertical velocity in the jth fluid layer is given by (3.7):
%
%  w_jn(z)= a_jn exp(kz) + b_jn exp(-kz) + z c_jn exp(k z) + z d_jn exp(-k z)
%
% The eight coefficients in (3.7) are expressed in terms of the nth coefficient
% of the interface position by means of the eight equations (2.27) and
% (2.19)-(2.25).
%
% Here, A is an 4 by 4 matrix containing:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function [A] = fhs_special_deep(k, mu)
  % Compute the square of the wave number
  k_squared = k^2;

  % Initialize the 4x4 matrix A with zeros
  A = zeros(4,4);

  % Define the z-coordinates for the bottom, interface, and top surfaces
  interface_surface = 0;

  % Eq1. Kinematic condition. (B1 in KT94)
  % dζ/dt = w @ z=z1
  A(1,:) = [1, interface_surface, 0, 0];

  % Eq2. Continuity of velocity at the interface (B2 in KT94)
  % w1 = w2 @ z=z1
  A(2,:) = [ 1,  interface_surface, -1, -interface_surface];

  % Eq3. Continuity of velocity derivative at the interface (B3 in KT94)
  % dw1/dz = dw2/dz @ z=z1
  A(3,:) = [ k,  (1 + k * interface_surface), k, -(1 - k * interface_surface)];

  % Eq4. Continuity of tangential stresses at the interface (B4 in KT94)
  % μ1(d2/dzz + k2)w1 = μ2(d2/dzz + k2)w2
  A(4,1:2) =  mu(1) .* [ 2*k_squared, (2*k_squared*interface_surface + 2*k)];
  A(4,3:4) = -mu(2) .* [ 2*k_squared, (2*k_squared*interface_surface - 2*k)];

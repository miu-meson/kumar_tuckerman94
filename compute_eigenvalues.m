% The coefficients A, and hence the system (3.12) depend on the Floquet exponent
% σ + iɑ via (3.8) and the boundary conditions (see Appendix B) in a complicated
% manner. However, the amplitude a of the external forcing appears linearly. 
% In fact, for fixed Floquet exponent, (3.12) can be considered to be an 
% eigenvalue problem with eigenvalues 'a' and eigenvectors 'v' whose components 
% are the real and imaginary parts of the ζ_n. 
% That is, we write (3.12) as the generalized eigenvalue problem
%
%   A ζ_n = a B ζ_n
%
% In (3.15), A is a diagonal complex matrix (see matrix_An) and B is a banded 
% matrix whose structure depends on ɑ (see banded_matrix_B).
